                    It's often not worth it to dwell on the past. However sometimes you need
                    to know where you have been in order to understand where you are. With the 
                    introduction of the new <a href="beams.html">bucket beams</a> in <code>v1.5.0</code>
                    I wanted to know exactly that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I build the last three Apache releases and ran two test suites 
                    against them. And the result is what you see below int he picture. It shows
                    how requests per second and megabytes per second have developed in 
                    <code>mod_http2</code> (the 2.4.x is basically a 2.4.20 with mod_http2 1.5.0
                    inside).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/eventlove.png">
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first test loads all resources from the famous http/2 gopher tile page (so
                    quite small resources) using 100 connections and allowing 100 concurrent
                    streams. The second test suite loads a 10 MB file 1000 times over 8 connections
                    allow 10 concurrent streams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And you see that performance with the <code>event mpm</code> module has
                    gotten a lot of love in the last weeks! Which is good, since it very
                    much deserves it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    (The other thing to see is that performance has degraded somewhat from
                    release to release for small requests. That is a side effect when you focus
                    on stability and features that performance optimizations need to wait. Bah!) 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are some more things I want to fine tune, maybe squeeze out some
                    more requests and megabytes. And if you want to help me test this, you
                    are very welcome to try the github releases here.
                </p>
